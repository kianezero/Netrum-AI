# How to Use Netrum CLI Commands

- **`netrum-system` :** This command checks your VPS system status, including CPU, RAM, and internet speed. Use it to make sure your machine meets the basic requirements before setup.


- **`netrum-new-wallet` :** Creates a new EVM-compatible wallet directly from the CLI. It will generate your public address and private key, all of which you should store securely.


- **`netrum-import-wallet` :** Allows you to import an existing wallet by entering your private key. This is useful if you already have a Base domain tied to a wallet you control.


- **`netrum-check-basename` :** Checks whether your current wallet has a registered Base domain name. Your Base name will also become your Netrum Node ID.


- **`netrum-node-id` :** Displays the current Node ID associated with your wallet. This is your official node identity on the Netrum network.


- **`netrum-node-sign` :** Generates a signed identity message using your wallet's private key. This signature verifies that you own the node and wallet.


- **`netrum-node-register` :** Registers your node on-chain and with the backend system. This step requires a small amount of BASE for gas (typically between 0.0002 and 0.0005 BASE).


- **`netrum-sync` :** Starts the syncing process between your node and the Netrum network. This keeps your node active and eligible to earn mining rewards.


- **`netrum-sync-log` :** Displays real-time logs showing your sync status, heartbeat signals, and activity tracking. Use this to confirm your node is working correctly.


- **`netrum-mining` :** Begins the mining process for NPT tokens. Your node will now start earning rewards based on uptime and active sync.


- **`netrum-mining-log` :** Shows live mining logs and confirms whether your node is earning tokens correctly. This is useful for monitoring daily activity


- **`netrum-claim` :** Lets you claim your mined NPT tokens after 24 hours of uptime. Once claimed, mining will automatically restart. This step requires a small amount of BASE for gas (around 0.00002 to 0.00003 BASE).


- **`netrum-wallet` :** Displays wallet information including your public address and NPT balance. Use this to check if your mined rewards have been received.


- **`netrum-wallet-key` :** Reveals both the public and private keys of your wallet. Only use this in a secure environment and never share your private key.


- **`netrum-wallet-remove` :** Deletes your wallet from the local VPS. Make sure to back up your private key or seed phrase before running this command, as this action cannot be undone.



# Features of Netrum Lite Node
These are the core capabilities of the Netrum Lite Node CLI, designed for speed, simplicity, and transparency.

### 1. Secure Wallet Management 
- You can create a new EVM-compatible wallet or import an existing one directly through the CLI.
Wallets are stored locally on your VPS, and your private key is never exposed or sent externally.

### 2. Unique Node Identity 
- Each node generates a unique identity like `netrum.lite.base.username`, linked to your Base domain.
This identity is signed and verified both by Netrum‚Äôs backend and the on-chain smart contract.

### 3. Server Sync & Uptime Tracking 
- The node maintains a real-time connection with the Netrum backend to report uptime and status.
Your uptime is continuously tracked to determine mining eligibility and is preserved across restarts.

### 4. On-Chain Registration 
- Your node is registered directly on a smart contract, ensuring your wallet and Node ID are verifiably linked.
This brings full transparency, decentralized ownership, and traceability to the entire setup.

### 5. Live NPT Token Mining 
- NPT tokens are mined based on your node‚Äôs uptime and contribution to the network.There‚Äôs no hardware mining involved, just consistent uptime and on-chain proof-of-participation.

### 6. Daily Reward Claim
- You can claim your mined NPT tokens every 24 hours through a simple one-line command.
Each claim is recorded on-chain, and tokens are sent directly to your connected wallet.

### 7. Lightweight & Easy to Use
- The CLI is fast, intuitive, and optimized for both developers and first-time node runners.
It runs smoothly on low-resource VPS machines and can be fully set up in under five minutes.
